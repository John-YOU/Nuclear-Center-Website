                <div id="cityu-content">

                    	<h1>Materials in Extreme Environments</h1>
                    	<p>Distinct from conventional engineering subject, nuclear environment is characterized by harsh level of radiation damage, very high operating temperature, and extreme corrosive environment, which poses demanding requirements on the design, fabrication of materials with superior mechanical, thermal and anti-corrosion properties. The design of current reactor materials subjected to extreme environmental conditions is a major obstacle to enhance safety and economic performance in nuclear energy systems. Extensive experimental research as well modeling analysis is being conducted for prediction of materials mixing and performance at different conditions. These studies show that slight variations in experimental environment parameters could significantly influence materials modification. Therefore to meet these challenges we need to develop a fundamental understanding of material response under extreme conditions of radiation flux, temperature, and corrosive environments. Overcoming these constraints will provide new opportunities to nuclear energy applications.</p>
                        <p>As safety and reliability are always main challenges in nuclear energy for nuclear fission reactor and magnetic fusion devices, material research under the extreme environment can significantly help scientists understand fundamental irradiation damage mechanisms. Chemical and physical processes must be understood at multiple scales from the atomic to the macroscopic size, and on time scales spread from picoseconds to many decades. An integration of new scientific tools will enable us to achieve our innovative research goals as several are described in following, including advanced material probes characterizing sub-nano scale properties, state-of art numerical models and simulation capabilities, as well as equipment for radiation damage measuring and corrosion test.</p>
                        <p>One research topic is that SiC has been one of the most promising and potential nuclear structural materials in both fission and fusion reactors for it has numerous attractive properties, including resistance to high neutron damage, low activation characteristics, excellent mechanical property and chemical resistance at high irradiation temperatures. Because large amount of radiation leakage during Fukushima Daiichi disaster was caused by hydrogen explosion induced from the oxidation of zircoloy cladding under high temperature, SiC is considered as an alternative candidate for the accident-tolerant fuel cladding materials in current commercial operating light water reactors. However, the accumulation of irradiation induced defects can lead to unwanted microstructural changes such as crystalline-to-amorphous transformation, extrinsic and intrinsic stacking fault, void swelling at high temperature irradiation, as well as lattice expansion at low temperature irradiation. A 2% homogeneous lattice expansion induced by large density of point defects is inevitable and thus should include in consideration for the degradation of the cladding capability and mechanical properties of SiC. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the production and evolution of radiation damage in SiC is crucial. Molecular dynamic simulation performed by LAMMPS as well as ab-initio model calculating the defect distribution in target material will also be integrated into this research to probe the atomic-scale defect structural evolution during irradiation. </p>
                        <p>Another crucial research topic is the possible application of high entropy alloys (HEAs) for nuclear fuel cladding material. High entropy alloys which can fulfill all the requirements to be the accident-tolerant fuel cladding material for the current operating light water reactors to prevent the disaster that was unfortunately happened in the Fukushima Accident again. Numerical and atomistic simulation benchmarking the experimental studies of radiation damage effects under normal operating water environments and high temperature steam conditions during accident is strongly needed. Molecular dynamic and analytical diffusion simulation are performed for radiation defect clusters in HEA in a wide temperature range. Resulting crystal structure would be detailed analyzed and compared with Spherical Aberration Corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (Cs-corrected STEM) and Synchrotron based X-ray diffraction (XRD) images for lattice plane distance, defect density, and crystalline ordering.  This thorough atomic-scale defect structural evolution during irradiation investigation will approach the physical origin of the lattice expansion and defect clusters formation as well as leading to a profound understanding of utilizing HEA as next generation accident tolerance cladding material.</p>
                        <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) for example has numerous unresolved plasma-material interaction problems. High plasma power and particle beams strike the reactor walls and divertor area which damage the exposed surfaces significantly. Therefore comprehensive multiphysics continuum model have to be integrated for simulation including evolution of the divertor material, resulting vaporization, heating and ionization of vapor plasma to higher temperatures, and photon radiation, transport. Continuum model is also suitable for deuterium and tritium accumulation in plasma-facing materials (PFM) under typical instability parameters of the edge-localized modes and disruption. Kinetic Monde Carlo as another modeling method applies to predicting edge plasma conditions and impurities concentration on deuterium deposition, diffusion and trapping. For the various reactor wall coating materials, beryllium for first wall and tungsten and carbon for divertor area, the subsequent PFMs surface evolution and the presence of materials mixing, segregation, blistering in near-surface as well as impurities co-deposition can be studied through molecular dynamics method. We focus on understanding hydrogen isotope retention in plasma-facing materials in fusion devices; estimate hydrogen isotope retention behavior in tungsten and potential other PFC candidates during normal operational pulse, effects of edge-localized modes (ELMs), and a possible cleaning processes scenario. </p>
                        <p>Understanding and predicting the evolution of material properties and phenomenal behaviors of nuclear fuels are major challenges for fuel design, operation and storage. However, the material properties and phenomenal behaviors is characterized by the multi-physics nature, in which the thermal, mechanical and chemical properties are intricately coupled and involve a large number of control parameters and uncertainties. Thus, to address environmental and reactor safety concerns, advanced fuel performance modeling and simulation capability is required. Fuel performance modeling and simulation tool will be developed considering heat generation and conduction, constituent redistribution, thermal expansion, elastic strain, densification, and fission product swelling, grain growth, fission gas production and release, gap heat transfer, mechanical contact, gap/plenum pressure with plenum volume, fuel thermal and irradiation creep, cladding thermal and irradiation creep and oxidation. All the models will be self-defined and implemented into fully coupled multiphysics framework. Multiple time and length scales are adopted for multiphysics phenomena fully coupled under irradiation. The capability development involves advanced models and detailed analytical study of fuel material properties and fuel performance, which not only benefits the existing reactor fuels performance prediction and understand multiple challenging physical phenomena under the radiation, corrosion and extreme high temperature environments,  but also benefits other nuclear energy research, for example, advanced next generation nuclear reactor research and nuclear energy advanced modeling and simulation. </p>
                        <p>The pursuit of accident tolerant fuel has become a focus for post-Fukushima nuclear research and development. The goal of accident tolerant fuel development is to identify alternative fuel system technologies to further enhance the safety, competitiveness, and economics of commercial nuclear power. The accident tolerant fuel can achieve improved fuel properties, including lower operating temperatures, improved fuel relocation/dispersion, fuel melting and fission products retention performance. The material properties and behavior under normal operation and accident scenarios will be studied for different accident tolerant fuel, including 1) Higher density fuels (metal, nitride, silicide); 2) Oxide fuels with additives; 3) Microencapsulated fuels. All the above advanced fuel concepts can achieve higher thermal conductivity to lower fuel operating temperatures and the chance of core melting. However, each concept has pros and cons across the spectrum of operating and transient conditions of interest. So, a systematic analytical evaluation is necessary and can be done through molecular dynamics and multiphysics fuel performance analysis.</p>
