                <div id="cityu-content">
                    <div class="cityu-content-page">
                        
                    	<h1>Nuclear Safety</h1>
                    	
                    	<p>The safety in nuclear reactor power plant is one of the most important concerns, which demands comprehensive research on thermal hydraulics, materials under extreme environment, neutrons, radiation detection and etc. Apart from the technological aspect, the nuclear safety also touches on the socio-economic, environmental dimensions. Thus, solutions to these challenges will require cooperative, interdisciplinary action involving engineering, natural science, and social science. We seek to develop new materials, systems simulation tools as well as risk management (early warning, mitigation, response, management, feedback and adaptation) to enhance the nuclear safety without impairing the viability and sustainability of the ecosystems.</p>
                        <p>Thermal hydraulics in nuclear system plays a significant role in supporting the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Thermal hydraulics research will improve the understanding of heat and mass transfer, and fluid mechanics processes which transport energy and mass in nuclear systems, and govern nuclear system performance and safety. One of the most urgent issues in the design of advanced thermal hydraulic systems is to ensure effective and efficient heat removal capacity in reactor accident conditions. Research in thermal hydraulics encompasses studies of single- and multi-phase flow, heat transfer, phase change, fluid dynamics, and various phenomena related to reactor safety. </p>
                        <p>Advanced experiments and models based on the mechanistic descriptions of multi-phase flow support advanced nuclear power systems. Separate effects experimental data along with special instrumentation support these models. Modeling and computational tools provide analytical methods for multi-phase flow studies, which include advanced multi-phase flow models, numerical methods, and multi-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These experiments and models are designed to develop a better understanding of multi-phase flow phenomena in nuclear reactors.</p>
                        <p>Condensation and boiling are the most efficient modes of heat transfer and are widely used in nuclear reactors, where quick removal of heat energy from a hot surface is desired. Some next generation nuclear reactor designs employ a passive heat exchanger that allows the transfer of reactor decay heat via steam condensation inside the condenser tubes to the outer water pool where pool boiling occurs. The heat exchanger must be able to remove sufficient energy from the reactor containment to prevent containment from exceeding its design pressure following a reactor accident. Hence a detailed knowledge of the variation of the heat transfer coefficient and its dependence on the system is necessary in order to predict the heat exchanger performance and for design optimization.</p>
                        <p>Liquid-vapor phase change by boiling and condensation is a highly efficient heat transport mode that accommodates large heat fluxes with relatively small temperature differences. Structured surfaces rendered by micro/nanotechnology provide great promise to advance phase change for enhanced thermal management and energy conversion. Despite exciting progress, our understanding of the complexities in phase change process with the incorporation of micro and nanostructures as well as the ability to rationally control such process remains challenging due to the interdisciplinary nature of the area. We will conduct mechanistic study of two-phase heat and flow physics at the multiple time and length scales as well as harnessing these insights to develop robust structured materials that can significantly promote two-phase heat and mass transfer. </p>
                        <p>The working fluid properties play an important role in enhancing multi-phase flow heat transfer. While water is a convenient medium for phase change heat transfer, its relatively poor heat transfer characteristic is a major disadvantage. We will also take advantage of the recent progress in the preparation of nanofluids and supercritical fluids to improve the safety and economy of the nuclear energy systems. Developing high-performance heat transfer fluids has been the subject of numerous investigations in the past few decades. Traditional solid-liquid mixtures containing suspended milli- or micro-sized solid particles have higher thermal conductivities than those of base fluids, but they have not been considered as a candidate for heat transfer applications in the past due to problems associated with them such as sedimentation, erosion, fouling and increased pressure drop. The rapid advancement of materials technology has been able to produce particles of nanometer size which when suspended in usual fluid can overcome most of the problems encountered by common slurries. Supercritical fluids, owing to the unique property of excellent heat transfer coefficient whereas there is no phase change (boiling) as temperature increases, holds promises to serve as efficient reactor coolant or working fluid in the power conversion cycle of the next generation nuclear energy systems. We will study the fundamental transport phenomena such as flow instability and heat transfer deterioration related with the supercritical fluids.</p>
                        <p>Robust instrumentation for monitoring and control of the complex thermal-hydraulics processes permits very detailed experimental studies of complex multi-phase flow and heat transfer phenomena. Nuclear thermal hydraulics test facility at CityU is equipped with advanced instruments for thermal hydraulics experiments such as computerized high-speed data acquisition systems, high speed cameras, high resolution camcorders, and transient temperature, pressure, and flow rate measurement units. Particularly, a two phase flow particle image velocimetry (PIV) system is adopted to measure simultaneously bubble geometry and flow velocity field, in addition to a high speed camera system to capture global and local data and images for multiphase flow phenomena, since two-phase flow visualization plays an important role in the experimental approach. Overall, the instrumentation is with advanced design, excellent functionality, and high accuracy results.</p>
                        <p>With the advances in the fundamental understanding of multi-phase flow and heat transfer, research and development in nuclear thermal hydraulics can improve significantly the operation and performance of nuclear reactors. These improvements are achieved mainly through the evolution in fuel design and best-estimate analytical methods used for the design and licensing of nuclear power plants. Not only nuclear thermal hydraulics is important for improved safety of the existing reactors, but also most of the advanced Generation IV reactors will require more thermal-hydraulic research and development effort prior to finalizing their designs, for example, Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR), Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR), Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR), and Super-Critical Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR).</p>
                        <p>Thermal hydraulics phenomena in nuclear reactor are complex and are highly dynamic. The flows are often two-phase and are highly transient especially during accident conditions. Conducting separate effects or integral experiments at the prototype scale is almost impossible to assess the safety systems and their performance. This is often the case for reactor primary thermal hydraulics systems where full-scale experiments would be dangerous and very costly. Hence downscaled models of the prototype are considered in testing thermal hydraulics phenomena. For the similarity to be achieved between the model and the prototype, they both (model and prototype) should have same physical phenomena and there need to be physical laws governing the similitude between both systems. The similarities in physical laws essentially provide the geometric, kinematic and dynamic similarity. These similarities expressed as criteria can be used to relate the model behavior to the prototype or vice-versa. The scaling process involves using similarity laws which provide scaling criteria. The similarity laws and scaling criteria are very important for the interpretation of the experimental results obtained from downscaled model and to relate to the prototype behavior. </p>
                        <p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), coupled with experiments using improved measurement techniques, is already helping in the design and licensing of advanced reactors. The capability of systems analysis code also needs to be expanded to include 3D effects and more coupling with neutronics, sub-channel and CFD codes. Further development and application of subchannel methods, which are less sophisticated than CFD but more practical because of the reduced computer requirements, need to be studied for detailed thermal-hydraulic analysis. As the computing power is increasing, advanced multi-physics methods are being developed at CityU to couple nuclear thermal hydraulics, neutronics and nuclear fuel performance together.</p>
                        <p>For multi-phase flow application in nuclear reactors, the computational model requires closure relations that cover all flow regimes and flow regime transitions from subcooled boiling, to bubbly and churn flow, to annular flow and dispersed annular/droplet flow with void fractions approaching 100%. Addition of a transport equation for the interfacial area is promising, and that should be further explored. </p>
                        <p>MBE has already equipped with a state-of-the-art industrial grade nuclear reactor simulator and severe accident analysis software MAAP. We are proposing to develop a three dimensional immersive display of nuclear power plant cruise using virtual reality technique and linking to our full scope simulator/CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) results together with creative media display technologies, which provides not only the cutting edge research but also alternative and impressive education for the students and public. In this project, GSE simulator (full scope pressurized water reactor), MAAP code (EPRI developed Modular Accident Analysis Program), and recently developed DesignEP Platform (which allows operator control of key MAAP) will be integrated to enable the cutting edge research on severe accident analysis and to be in line with general consensus of the international severe accident community. Advanced methodology of severe nuclear accident analysis will be developed including the dispersion of radioactive materials after a severe accident. As the rapid development of nuclear power industry in mainland China, more and more nuclear power plants are being built with significant number of them will be located surrounding Hong Kong. It becomes an urgent need for public education on nuclear safety and training of nuclear engineers. The advanced simulator developed in this project will strongly facilitate this urgent demand.</p>
                        <p>Recent Fukushima nuclear accident revealed again that severe nuclear accidents, which involves reactor core melting, have the potential to occur. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the radioactive material release and mitigate the impact of the environment after the core melting. To increase the retention of the radioactive materials in the containment, the complicated phenomena, such as the extreme high temperature molten corium reactions with cold water and containment concrete, need to be understood in order to develop the mitigation measures. Although a lot of research efforts have been conducted by the community, the mechanisms and consequences of the phenomena for MCCI and steam explosion are still not fully understood. Therefore, our motivation is to conduct extensive theoretical studies, numerical simulations and experiments in order to understand the mechanism of the phenomena. We will also explore the advanced technologies to mitigate the impact of the severe accident scenarios such as using nanofluids as coolant. Preliminary results had shown that the retention of the radioactive materials in the containment will be improved by using nanofluids as coolant. The extensive researches through simulations and experiments will be conducted in this project to investigate the fundamental mechanism and behavior of nanofluids applications in order to develop the strategies to mitigate the severe accident consequences.</p>
                        <p>Once the severe nuclear accident occurred, it is crucial to ensure the reliable power supply to operate the safety systems especially in the condition of loss of off-site power such as during Fukushima nuclear accident. Besides the crucial needs of the backup power during severe accidents, it is also very important to have reliable battery energy storage system to ensure efficient and safe operations of the nuclear power plants. Therefore, we will perform the research in the development of the reliable large scale battery energy storage systems. The all-vanadium redox flow battery energy storage system (VRB-ESS) has to date shown the greatest potential for large-scale energy storage applications with long cycle life and high energy efficiencies of over 80% in large installations. The application of VRB-ESS to the nuclear energy systems as the backup power source after severe accidents will be explored. The operational characteristics of VRB-ESS and its integration will the nuclear safety systems will be investigated. </p>
                        <p>Through the experimental and numerical approaches on multi-phase flow, heat transfer, thermal hydraulics and severe accident analysis, we aim to develop deeper understanding of the fundamental physical phenomena, nuclear thermal hydraulics, and nuclear severe accident scenarios, and a detailed knowledge is also crucial for the design optimization, safe operation and emergency preparedness of nuclear reactors.
